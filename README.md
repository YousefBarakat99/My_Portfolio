Welcome to my portfolio! Here you will find some of the exciting projects I have worked on in Python, SQL, and Excel. :nerd_face: The code for all the projects is hosted on my [Github profile](https://github.com/myusername). I will constantly update the portfolio as I complete more projects.

## Streamlit :computer:

### Web Scraping Visualization :globe_with_meridians:
I hosted previously scraped data from a different project on streamlit with different tabs, pages and visualizations. This is just a skill I learnt to display my flexibility with different environments.

## Python Projects :snake:

### Web Scraping
In this project, I scraped data related to houses for sale/rent from 3 well-known local website where I live. The data included information such as price, size, number of rooms, and address of the property. Both Selenium and BeautifulSoup4 were used. The data can be exported to an excel file once the script is run. :house_with_garden:

### Sea Level Predictor
In this project, I analyzed a dataset of global average sea level change since 1880 and used it to predict the sea level change through the year 2050. :ocean:

### Demographic Data Analyzer
In this project, I analyzed demographic data using Pandas. I had access to a dataset of demographic data that was extracted from the 1994 Census database. I used Pandas to identify patterns and answer some questions related to the data. :bar_chart:

### Analysis of Page Visits
In this project, I visualized time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. I used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The data visualizations helped me understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth. :chart_with_upwards_trend:

### Medical Data Visualizer
In this project, I visualized and made calculations from medical examination data using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas. The dataset values were collected during medical examinations. :pill:

### Movie Data Analysis
In this project, I cleaned a large database of movie data spanning from 1980 to 2020 and checked for different correlations along the different characteristics of the movies. I also visualized some of that data using Matplotlib and Seaborn. :movie_camera:

## SQL Projects :floppy_disk:

### Covid Data Analysis
In this project, I analyzed worldwide covid-related data regarding deaths and vaccinations using SQL. I explored various different functions to demonstrate my SQL skills. I also created some views to use in Tableau to create visualizations. :microbe:

### Data Cleaning
In this project, I accessed data regarding housing in Nashville, USA and examined it. The data was in need of cleaning in terms of removing or populating null values, the creation of new columns, categorizing the data amongst other requirements. :house:

## Excel :bar_chart:
You can find my Excel projects [here](https://github.com/YousefBarakat99/My_Portfolio/tree/main/Excel/Bike)

## Tableau :bar_chart:
This holds all of my Tableau dashboards.
